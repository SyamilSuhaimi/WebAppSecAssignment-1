        <h2>Research Ethics</h2>
        <h3>Difficulties Faced in the Research Process</h3>
        <p>During the research process, I encountered certain difficulties, including limited time due to work commitments and family occasions. These constraints posed challenges in terms of allocating sufficient time and resources for in-depth research and analysis. However, I managed these difficulties by planning and organizing my schedule effectively, making the most of the available research time.</p>

        <h3>Lessons Learned about the Research Process</h3>
        <p>One major lesson I learned about the research process is the importance of defining clear objectives and research questions at the outset. This ensures focused and effective research, allowing for more meaningful findings and insights. Additionally, I have developed a deeper understanding of the significance of proper citation and referencing in preventing plagiarism and maintaining research integrity.</p>

        <h3>Steps Taken to Prevent Plagiarism</h3>
        <p>When working with outside evidence, I take several steps to prevent plagiarism. These include conducting thorough literature reviews, taking diligent notes, properly attributing sources through in-text citations, and providing complete references in the bibliography section. By following these ethical practices, I maintain the integrity of my research and uphold the intellectual property rights of others.</p>
