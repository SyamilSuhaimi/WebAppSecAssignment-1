        <h3>Mind Mapping</h3>
        <p>To provide a comprehensive understanding of web application threats, I have created a mind map. It visualizes the different types of threats, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, along with their potential impact on web security.</p>

        <h3>Web Apps Security Architecture</h3>
        <p>In this section, I delve into the fundamental concepts and components of web application security architecture. I explore various layers of security, including secure coding practices, input validation, and access control mechanisms. By understanding the architecture of secure web applications, developers can design and implement robust security measures to protect against potential threats.</p>

                <h4>Title 1: 7 Common Web Application Security Threats</h4>
                <p>
                    The article discusses seven common web application security threats that businesses should be aware of in order to protect sensitive data and secure their systems. It emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations during the development phase of web applications and provides recommendations for prevention.

                    The first threat mentioned in the article is injection attacks. These attacks occur when a web application accepts untrusted data without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to trick the server into interpreting it as a system command. Injection attacks include SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Email Header Injection. To prevent injection attacks, the article recommends keeping untrusted inputs away from commands and queries, using a safe API, and filtering and sanitizing all inputs based on a whitelist [1].

                    The second threat discussed is broken authentication, which refers to vulnerabilities in the implementation of authentication and session management tokens. This can allow hackers to claim a legitimate user's identity, access their sensitive data, and exploit their privileges. The article suggests measures to prevent broken authentication, such as ending sessions after a period of inactivity, invalidating session IDs, placing limiters on password complexity, and implementing multi-factor authentication [1].

                    The third threat highlighted is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which is an injection-based client-side attack. It involves injecting malicious code into a website application to execute in the victims' browsers. The article suggests validating untrusted data, encoding output to prevent script execution, and implementing content security policies to mitigate XSS attacks [1].

                    The article also discusses other threats, including insecure direct object references, security misconfigurations, sensitive data exposure, and XML external entity (XXE) attacks. It provides an overview of each threat and offers recommendations on how to prevent or mitigate them [1].

                    Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of common web application security threats and offers practical prevention measures. It emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations from the development phase and provides specific recommendations for each threat discussed.

                <h4>Title 2: 13 Best Practices for Improving Web Application Security</h4>
                <p>This article provides a comprehensive list of 13 best practices for web application security. It covers various aspects of web application security, including the use of web application firewalls (WAFs), API security, following the OWASP Top 10, leveraging existing tools and standards, updating dependencies, and ensuring proper security configuration. The article emphasizes the importance of integrating security into the software development lifecycle and staying informed about security changes. By implementing these best practices, developers can enhance the security of their web applications and protect them from potential attacks. [1]</p>
