        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my web application security reflective portfolio. Through this portfolio, I aim to educate users about the importance of web and application security while enhancing their security awareness. By exploring various aspects of web security, I hope to empower individuals to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to safeguard their online presence.</p>
        <p>Throughout this journey, I have come to realize the limitations of my previous knowledge regarding web security. However, I have acquired new skills that have enabled me to identify potential web application threats and think outside the box, adopting the mindset of a hacker. This fresh perspective has empowered me to easily identify web vulnerabilities and develop effective countermeasures.</p>
